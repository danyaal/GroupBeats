##About GroupBeats
It is an online jukebox for parties, where anyone can add their favorite songs to the playlist by whipping out their phone or laptop and just typing it in. Also everyone can vote on  the songs on the playlist and based on the votes, certain songs are picked next on the list to create the best party possible!
