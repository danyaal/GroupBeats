This is a web application that Pratik Kabra(github.com/pkabra), Rahul Raina(github.com/rraina), Kyle Summers, and I worked on at a hackathon!

It is basically an online jukebox for parties, where anyone can add their favorite songs to a main playlist. Then everyone can vote on songs and based on the votes, certain songs are picked next on the list.

This hack won us first place at the hackathon!

I hope you guys enjoy it! :)
